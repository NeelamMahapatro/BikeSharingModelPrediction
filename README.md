# BikeSharingModelPrediction with Linear Regression Model

## Problem Statement
* Boombikes , a US based bike-sharing company has suffered considerable loss in revenues due to Corona pandemic. To understand what data is affecting the demand for bike in the locality/country. The company wants to know:
  1. Which variables are mostly affecting the demand for the shared bike.
  2. How good are those variables in predicting the demand The objective of this project is to analyse the dataset and come up with a linear regreassion model to predict      demand on basis of some independent variables.


* The privide dataset has various features such as season, year,month, day of week,weather condition (temperrature,humidity,windspeed), type of day(weekday or weekend) and target variable i.e. count of bike sales on a particular day.
